Python code for playing around with the Collatz conjecture (3n + 1 problem), a famous problem in mathematics. This code represents numbers as binary strings, allowing it to work with very large values (I have tested convergence for numbers as large as 2^10,000). Also performs exhaustive tests for convergence.
